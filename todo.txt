Fixes / unfinished:
- do something better with licence?
- transition to using HudElements for hotbarCounts and emptySlotCount
- clean up readme

Improvements / refinements:
- add icon near emptySlotCount to make its function more apparent
- config options to control location of empty slots label

Features (under consideration, maybe maybe not gonna be implemented):
- display exact durability of tools on-screen when they are held
- keybind to use item in off hand even if main hand has an action
    - likely implemented as swap-and-use-and-swap-back
    - conflict between block-picking and use-offhand; which button to default to? 3?
- "inverse health bar" on entity models; a small red bar (visible from all angles; possibly multiple bars) that
    increase in size as the entity gets damaged.  Bar should "fill" its space when the entity dies; this is to
    unobtrusively indicate entity health.  (out of theme?)
- entity info picking: in the vein of health bars, pick an entity (eg. with mmb) to display information about it in chat
    (might be out of theme?)
- armor: when holding in hand / hovering over an armor piece, indicate visually i) how much armor it provides, and
    ii) what the difference is between that and the currently equipped armor
- armor: when using an armor item (option: of equal or better quality) with an existing armor item equipped, swap
    them out instead of doing nothing
- clock item: show exact time (pop-up hud?), show real time
    - with hud when held in main/off hand?
- (out of scope, but an idea) Fork and modify AppleSkin mod to simulate saturation usage client-side.


Big Features: (likely out of scope)
- macro creation?  (might be out of theme)
    - perform commands / keypresses / inventory actions in sequence
    - listen for input from chat / events in world
    - loops and conditional control flow
    - etc.
- Add HUD elements (default off):
    - Will want "hud picker" mode to move all these things around the hud
    - clock (options: location on hud, present in each dimension, works in nether / end)
    - normal compass (options: location on hud, present in each dimension, works in nether / end)
    - bound compass(es) pointing to a particular location? (options: location(s) on hud, present in nether/end,
        works in nether/end)
    - strict compass pointing north always (options: location on hud, present in each dimension, works in nether/end)
