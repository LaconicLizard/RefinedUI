Improvements / refinements:


Features:
- right-click on cycling buttons to go the other direction
    - in particular, the graphics "fast / fancy / fabulous" button, to allow skipping "fabulous" if your pc can't handle it
- keybind to use item in off hand even if main hand has an action
    - likely implemented as swap-and-use-and-swap-back
    - conflict between block-picking and use-offhand; which button to default to? 3?
- above hotbar (and off-hand!) display total number of those items in inventory
    - eg. if you have 1000 stone in inventory and a stack in hotbar, then display "1064" above that hotbar slot
    - nothing above empty slots, including offhand
- "inverse health bar" on entity models; a small red bar (visible from all angles; possibly multiple bars) that
    increase in size as the entity gets damaged.  Bar should "fill" its space when the entity dies; this is to
    unobtrusively indicate entity health.  (out of theme?)
- entity info picking: in the vein of health bars, pick an entity (eg. with mmb) to display information about it in chat
    (might be out of theme?)
- show hunger saturation (is there a mod that already does this?  is this even client-side?)
- show how much hunger/saturation the held food item will fill (is there a mod that already does this?
    is this even client-side?)
    - also display this in tooltips
- armor: when holding in hand / hovering over an armor piece, indicate visually i) how much armor it provides, and
    ii) what the difference is between that and the currently equipped armor
- armor: when using an armor item (option: of equal or better quality) with an existing armor item equipped, swap
    them out instead of doing nothing
- clock item: show exact time (pop-up hud?), show real time
    - with hud when held in main/off hand?

Big Features: (likely out of theme)
- macro creation?  (might be out of theme)
    - perform commands / keypresses / inventory actions in sequence
    - listen for input from chat / events in world
    - loops and conditional control flow
    - etc.
- Add HUD elements (default off):
    - Will want "hud picker" mode to move all these things around the hud
    - clock (options: location on hud, present in each dimension, works in nether / end)
    - normal compass (options: location on hud, present in each dimension, works in nether / end)
    - bound compass(es) pointing to a particular location? (options: location(s) on hud, present in nether/end,
        works in nether/end)
    - strict compass pointing north always (options: location on hud, present in each dimension, works in nether/end)
