Features:
    - textFieldClear: uses TextFieldWidget_Mixin
    - cycleButtonBack: uses OptionButtonWidget_Mixin for the correctly implemented buttons, ButtonWidget_Mixin for the rest.
        Also requires lots of accessors.
    - hotbarCounts: uses InGameHud_Mixin

Omitted Features:
    In-scope:
        - Display saturation on hunger bar; display hunger/saturation amounts on food items when hovering/holding them.
            Reason: this functionality is already provided by the mod "AppleSkin" (https://github.com/squeek502/AppleSkin)
            AppleSkin is as client-side as it can get; a bit of testing with ClientPlayNetworkHandler indicates that
            the server does not send saturation-updating packets unless the player's health/hunger changes.  AppleSkin,
            despite saying that it "should" be on the server side as well, functions as well as it can as a client-side
            mod.  To avoid duplicating functionality, we leave this to them.
    Out of Scope:
